Repo for my course notes and sample JS files

The course is from CodeCademy - Learn Javascript

This git repo is primarily to host my notes, and my sample code from the lesson.
This also gives me the opportunity to use github to work on my files wherever I am.

One other use for this repo is for test code, things that I'm playing with to help me learn.
